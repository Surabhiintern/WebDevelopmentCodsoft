I am delighted to be a part of Codsoft Web Development, where I have acquired new skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Throughout this experience, I have enhanced my knowledge in website development. I successfully completed three tasks: creating a functional calculator, designing a personal portfolio, and developing an engaging music landing page. Each project has honed my coding abilities and design sense. This journey has been incredibly rewarding and educational.
